IMAGE CRYPTOSYSTEM USING DYNAMIC AES AND QUADRATIC MAP-BASED KEY GENERATION

 
Digital images play a critical role in domains like healthcare, defense, and social platforms, making them highly vulnerable to unauthorized access and security threats. While traditional cryptographic algorithms like AES are commonly used for image encryption, directly applying AES often results in high computational complexity, strong pixel correlation, and inefficiencies with large image datasets.

To address these challenges, this project integrates a quadratic chaotic map with a dynamic AES framework, enhancing security and reducing predictability. The encryption performance was rigorously evaluated using histogram analysis, correlation analysis, entropy, NPCR, and UACI metrics, demonstrating improved randomness and robustness.
